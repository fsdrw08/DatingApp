# Try Out Development Containers: .NET Core

This is a sample project that lets you try out the **[VS Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)** extension in a few easy steps.

> **Note:** If you're following the quick start, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section. 

## Setting up the development container

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please follow the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

   Or open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Remote-Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the ".NET Core" sample, wait for the container to start and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use **Remote-Containers: Open Repository in Container...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem.

3. If you want to enable **HTTPS**, see [enabling HTTPS](#enabling-https) to reuse your local development cert in the container.

## Things to try

One you have this sample opened in a container, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Restore Packages:** When notified by the C# extension to install packages, click Restore to trigger the process from inside the container!

2. **Edit:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.

3. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `dotnet --version` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.

4. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `Program.cs`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 21).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
   - Continue, then open a local browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` and note you can connect to the server in the container.

5. **Forward another port:**
   - Stop debugging and remove the breakpoint.
   - Open `launch.json`
   - Add `"ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Endpoints__Http__Url": "http://*:9000",` to the `"env"` property.

        > **Note:** By default, ASP.NET Core only listens to localhost. If you use the `appPort` property in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, the port is [published](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwarded. Unfortunately, this means that ASP.NET Core only listens to localhost inside the container itself, not externally. It needs to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` instead to resolve the issue.
        >
        > This container solves that problem by setting the environment variable `ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Endpoints__Http__Url` to `http://*:5000` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. By using an environment variable to override this setting in the container only, you can leave your actual application config as-is for use when running locally.

   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run the **Remote-Containers: Forward Port from Container...** command.
   - Select port 9000.
   - Click "Open Browser" in the notification that appears to access the web app on this new port.

### Enabling HTTPS

To enable HTTPS for this sample, you can mount an exported copy of your local dev certificate. First, export it using the following command:

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "$env:USERPROFILE/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
```

**macOS/Linux terminal**

```powershell
dotnet dev-certs https --trust; dotnet dev-certs https -ep "${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx" -p "SecurePwdGoesHere"
```

Next, update the following properties in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`:

```json
"mounts": [
    "source=${env:HOME}${env:USERPROFILE}/.aspnet/https,target=/home/vscode/.aspnet/https,type=bind"
],
"remoteEnv": {
    "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Endpoints__Http__Url": "http://*:5000",
    "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Endpoints__Https__Url": "https://*:5001",
    "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password": "SecurePwdGoesHere",
    "ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path": "/home/vscode/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx"
}
```

Finally, rebuild the container using the **Remote-Containers: Rebuild Container** command from the Command Palette (<kbd>F1</kbd>) if you've already opened your folder in a container so the settings take effect.
